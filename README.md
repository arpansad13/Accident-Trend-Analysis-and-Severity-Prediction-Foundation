# Accident-Trend-Analysis-and-Severity-Prediction-Foundation

**Overview:** This dataset contains detailed information on traffic accidents across various regions and time periods. It includes various metrics such as accident date, weather conditions, lighting conditions, crash types, injuries, and vehicle involvement. The data spans multiple locations and accident types, offering a comprehensive view of traffic incidents and their causes.

**Objective**
  * Accident Analysis: Analyze accident trends, types, and the severity of injuries across different locations, time periods, and conditions.
  *  Traffic Safety: Understand the factors contributing to accidents (e.g., weather, lighting, road conditions) to inform traffic safety measures.
  *  Predictive Modeling: Use the dataset to forecast accident hotspots, potential injuries, and the impact of various factors on crash severity.
